### Publications
- BaTEClaCor: A Novel Dataset for Bangla Text Error Classification and Correction(BLP workshop at EMNLP2023)
                        + Conducted research on error detection and correction in Bangla communication using machine learning and deep learning models
                        + Performed ETL to curate, classify, and annotate a dataset with 10,000 real Bangla comments from Youtube
                        + Experimented and demonstrated BanglaBERT's accuracy in error-category classification
                        + Experimented and highlighted BanglaT5's effectiveness with a Rouge-L score of 0.845 for text correction
                        + Contributed to the enchancement of linguistic precision in the Bangla-speaking community
