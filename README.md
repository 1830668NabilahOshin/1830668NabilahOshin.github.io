### Publications
- **BaTEClaCor: A Novel Dataset for Bangla Text Error Classification and Correction**  (_BLP workshop at EMNLP2023_)  
    + Conducted research on error detection and correction in Bangla communication using machine learning and deep learning models
    + Performed ETL to curate, classify, and annotate a dataset with 10,000 real Bangla comments from Youtube
    + Experimented and demonstrated BanglaBERT's accuracy in error-category classification
    + Experimented and highlighted BanglaT5's effectiveness with a Rouge-L score of 0.845 for text correction
    + Contributed to the enchancement of linguistic precision in the Bangla-speaking community
- **AI-based Software Testing** (_ISBM 2023_)
    + Developed an in-depth review paper on AI-based software testing, showcasing benefits like efficiency enhancement, improved test coverage, and cost-effectiveness.
    + Highlighted AI technologies like machine learning and natural language processing to automate testing phases, including generation, execution and analysis.
    + Addressed critical challenges in AI-based testing such as data quality, interpretability, bias and model maintenance, offering actionable strategies tailored for small software firms
    + Key findings revealed enhanced testing efficiency,precise defect detection, and reduced costs through AI integration, alongside challenges like data quality and interpretability needing ongoing attention.
- **Food Rotting Prediction and Detection System for WareHouse** (_IEEE Region 10 Symposium - TENSYMP2023_)
    + Utilized real-time sensor data to train models and predict the likelihood of food entering the next stage of spoilage, triggering alerts as needed.
    + Programmed an Arduino UNO to read and interpret analogue inputs from multiple sensors simultaneously.
    + Applied logistic functions and coefficient estimation for predictive modelling and decision-making based on threshold probabilities.
    + Contributed to research aimed at enhancing food spoilage prediction and real-time monitoring systems.
